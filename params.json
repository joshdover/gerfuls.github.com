For real programming I like Objective-C & C++. For the web, I'm still a PHP lover, but I'm working my way through finding the love for Rails. I'm an avid lean startup enthusiast and I'm always look for new opportunities to start a business, project, app, site. If you're looking for some more code crunchers, never hesitate to ask, I'll probably say yes ;-)\r\n\r\n### Find Me\r\nI love learning new stuff and learn the best by learning from other people (not books), and I want to get to know you: [@joshdover](http://twitter.com/joshdover) or [+Josh Dover](http://plus.google.com/111814027622986390187)","google":""}
